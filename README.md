# AI_LTH
Projects for the Artificial Intelligence class (EDAP01) in Lund University (LTH)

The first project's goal was to create an adversarial player. Using the Minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning, I created a player which will almost always win in a game of Connect-4 against an adversary. 

The second project was about a robot localizer. Using filters, the robot is now able to determine accurately its location.

The third project was a Jupyter Notebook where we could explore Machine Learning methods: linear regression, logistic regression and perceptron.
